  \item \(X \in \mathcal{T}\) and \(\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}\)
  \item  the union of any finite or infinite number of sets in \(\mathcal{T}\) is a set in
      \(\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{T}\) is closed under arbitrary unions)
    \item  the intersection of finitely many sets in \(\mathcal{T}\) is a set in \(\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{T}\) 
        is closed under finite intersections).

In this case, we call the pair \((X, \mathcal{T})\) a topological space.
